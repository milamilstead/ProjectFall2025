TODO: In your own words: what can you say about use of AI in coding? How did you approach this problem if some other method than discussed in class? Different sites, different techniques, combination of programming and AI, etc.
AI has become a really helpful tool in this course. It’s interesting because most of my other professors are against using it and push learning to code without any assistance. For me though, AI has made a huge difference, especially since coding isn’t one of my strongest areas in CS. When I started this project, the first thing I did was type a simple prompt and ask AI to list out all the steps I needed to complete. After that, I moved on to building the application itself, and getting it to run wasn’t difficult at all. With just one search, I was able to generate a full working version of the code. The part that gave me the most trouble was getting the tests to pass and figuring out why they were failing. At first it was small things like typos, but then the test cases weren’t lining up with the actual behavior of the program. I fixed those issues by using AI again, pasting in my code and asking it to find the errors. Overall, I used a mix of my own programming and AI help to finish the project, and that combination made everything much more manageable.
